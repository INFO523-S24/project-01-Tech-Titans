## Introducing the Dataset

-   The presentation is created using the Quarto CLI

-   `##` sets the start of a new slide

## Question 1: 

You can use plain text

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   or bullet points[^1]
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
or in two columns
:::
:::

[^1]: And add footnotes

-   like

-   this

## Candle Stick Plot


## Line Plot and Bar Plot

## Insights


## Question 2:

## Normalized Stock Price over Time

## 50, 200 Day Moving Averages 

## Insights

## Conclusion

## Thank You!


## Code

```{python}
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import statsmodels.api as sm
import pandas as pd

# Fit a linear regression model
#X = mtcars[['speed']]
#y = mtcars['mpg']
#model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)

# Summary of the model
#X2 = sm.add_constant(X)
#est = sm.OLS(y, X2)
#est2 = est.fit()
#print(est2.summary())
```

## Plots

```{python}
#penguins['species'] = penguins['species'].apply(lambda x: #"Adelie" if x == "Adelie" else "Other")
#sns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x='flipper_length_mm', #y='body_mass_g', hue='species')
#plt.show()
```

## Plot and text

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Some text

-   goes here
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{python}
#| warning: false
#| fig.width: 5.5

```
:::
:::

# A new section...

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{python}

```

## Images

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g.Â \$\\alpha+\\beta\$ renders $\alpha + \beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```         
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

# Wrap up

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
