The dataset encompasses a range of data types, including numerical values like stock prices and trading volumes and categorical data such as company names and dates. This composition enables a comprehensive examination of stock market trends, facilitates comparisons across various companies, and aids in assessing the influence of significant external events on stock valuations."

    "text": "Analysis plan\n\nVariables Involved\nThe variables which we use from the Big Tech Companies Dataset are: - 1 stock_symbol: The stock symbol representing the technology company on the stock exchange. - 2 company: The full name of the technology company.\nThe variables which we use from the Big Tech Stock Prices Dataset are:\n\n1 stock_symbol: The stock symbol of the technology company, allowing for identification of the company’s stock data.\n2 date: The date the stock prices were recorded.\n3 open: The price at which the stock first traded upon the exchange opening that day.\n4 high: The highest price the stock traded during the trading day.\n5 low: The lowest price the stock traded during the trading day.\n6 close: The final price the stock traded during the trading day.\n7 adj_close: The closing price after adjustments for all applicable splits and dividend distributions.\n8 volume: The total number of shares traded during the trading day.\n\n\n\nQ1\nAnalyzing stock prices from Big Tech Stock Price dataset over time using open, close, high, and low values. Creating visualizations like candlestick charts, line plots and bar plots to gain insights into the stock’s behavior. Bar plot depicts the volume of the stock which implies that taller the bar higher the stock trade. Each day has a total of 8 variables.\n\nAnalysis\nWe plan to answer question one by investigating the rate of change of trading volume and average price over time to find trends that reveal good times to invest, i.e. when stock prices are about to grow exponentially, we would invest our money. Inversely, if we saw an exponential decrease in price over time, we would want to take our money out ASAP.\n\n\n\nQ2\nTo determine the value of an investment in 2022 based on an initial investment in 2010, we need to know the annual rate of return of the investment over that time period. Without this information, it’s impossible to calculate the exact value of the investment in 2022.\nHowever, we can make some generalizations:\n\n1.Using Historical Market Data\n2.Consulting Financial Professionals\n\n\nAnalysis\nWe will use DMA(daily moving averages) to create a generalized equation for how each stock grows over time, we can then see how money will grow in each stock by setting an initial investment and seeing its final value in 2022. To do so, we need to understand factors like inflation and interest rates, as well as annual rate of return."
