    "text": "Introduction to the Dataset\nThe dataset used in this analysis was sourced from Tidy Tuesday; an open source conglomeration of data for visualization and machine learning. The dataset contains information on 14 different Big Tech companies’s stock price and trading volume from 2010 to 2022 on the New York Stock Exchange. There are two .csv (comma seperated variable) files used, one called “big_tech_stock_prices.csv” and another called “big_tech_companies.csv”. For simplicity, the files are renamed “stocks” and “companies”, respectively. Stocks contains a majority of the information used in this analysis, including the daily low, high, open, and close prices, as well as trading volume. Low price represents the lowest price for the day while high price represents the opposite. Open price represents the price when the market opens at 9:30am ET, and close price represents the price when the market closes at 4pm ET. Trading volume represents the amount of stocks bought and sold that day; this metric is important for understanding the popularity of the stock.\nThe interest in this dataset was sparked by its potential to provide valuable insights into the stock market behavior of big tech companies. This enables a comprehensive examination of stock market trends, facilitates comparisons across various companies, and aids in assessing the influence of significant external events on stock valuations."

Looking at price changes temporally will provide insights into past trends in the stock market. The stock market is cyclical, and thus finding patterns in the past data will allow for insights into future movements of the stock market. This is benefical because it can lead to knowledge of when a stock price will rise.

This allows for a basic understanding of the distribution of the data and how metrics such as outliers influence the spread of the data. Once a basic understanding of the data is formed, the data is then visualized.\nOne step that is typically used for raw, uncleaned data is filtering. This allows for the data to be manipulated to ensure a normal distribution (or other distribution required by the ML model). In the case of this analysis, filtering and cleaning is not needed because the data is already in a form that can be visualized easily.\nFinally, the data is visualized in three plots, a candlestick plot, a line plot, and a bar plot. The candlestick plot is a line plot where each data point is a bar that shows the open, close, high, and low prices. The size of the bar represents the volume of stocks traded in that day. The bars are then connected by a line and when looking at the entire time frame, trends can be seen. The line plot will be used to show the closing prices over time. The bar plot will show the overall volume of trading of each stock in the entire time frame. These three plots will be plotly objects, and thus can be manipuated and zoomed in on to see trends both globally and regionally over the time period. The candle stick will provide a convient display of all the data, while the line and bar plots break down the candle stick plot to scrutinize the data on a magnified scale.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe findings from data preprocessing and visualization reveals multiple insights. First, beyond cyclical fluxations, the price of every stock has increased since the initial 2010 open. Additionally, not all companies existed in 2010 and thus it can be seen that some stocks don’t appear until after 2010. Another valuable insight found was the large increase in growth of a majority of the companies in 2018. If this trend is to continue, it is beneficial to invest in the market now, though it would be wise to view other companies that have experienced exponential growth and review the times before prices settled to a lower value, the dot com boom of the early 2000s would be a good case study.\nLooking at the bar plot of all companies, it is clear that Apple was the most popular stock in the dataset, this is clear from its 150% larger volume than the next most traded stock. Finally, the crash caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is clearly visible across all the companies, when in the March of 2020, stock prices plummetted."

This analysis aims to determine the value of an investment made in 2010 in various technology stocks and its worth in 2022. To answer this, we’ll need the historical closing prices of each stock, which will help us to calculate the investment’s growth over the specified period. The second part of the analysis aims to determine good and bad times to pull an investment out of the market.\nFirst, we’re loading up all the stock and company information from two CSV files. We then make copies of this data to work with, ensuring we don’t mess with the original files. The goal here is to gather basic statistics like the average, median, highest, lowest, and standard deviation for various aspects of the stock prices, such as the opening and closing prices. This provides us with a summary that gives a broad overview of each stock’s performance over time.\n\n\nSummary Statistics:\n                    open

any gaps (missing values). Then, we’re doing some detective work to spot any weird or extreme data points—what we call ‘outliers’—that might throw off our analysis. We use the method Z-score to find these outliers, which helps us measure how unusual a data point is. If it’s too far from what’s normal (more than 3 standard deviations), we remove it to keep our data clean.\n\n\nNull Values from Stocks dataset stock_symbol    0\ndate            0\nopen            0\nhigh            0\nlow             0\nclose           0\nadj_close       0\nvolume          0\ndtype: int64\nNull Values from companies dataset stock_symbol    0\ncompany         0\ndtype: int64\n\n\n\n\nApproach\nTo understand how an investment has grown, we’ll look at the stock prices at the start of 2010 and compare them to the end of 2022. We’ll adjust these prices so that they all start at the same point, which makes it fair to compare different stocks. This way, we’re not distracted by some stocks being naturally more expensive than others; we’re focusing purely on how much they have grown proportionally.\nWe’re going to use line charts to show this growth over time. Each company’s growth curve will have its own color, making it easy to see which stocks are stars and which are not. These charts help us spot the times when stocks were soaring and when they were not doing so well.\nTo understand when to buy or sell a stock, we’ll use a common technique called the moving average crossover. Think of this as tracking two different running averages of a stock’s price: one that looks at the last 50 days (short-term view) and another that looks at the last 200 days (long-term view). When the short-term line crosses above the long-term line, it’s like a green light that the stock’s price might be heading up—a hint that it might be a good time to buy. When it crosses below, it’s a red flag that prices could be going down, suggesting it might be time to sell.\nWe’ll map these two averages onto a chart, which will help us spot exactly where these crossovers happen. It’s a straightforward method but well-regarded in the finance world for spotting when a stock’s trend might be changing direction.\nOur analysis will calculate these two averages for each stock and lay them over a chart of the stock’s actual prices. We’re looking for where these average lines cross over each other—these are the critical moments that might signal to investors to act. To showcase this, we’ll use a type of chart called a candlestick chart, which is great for showing not just the average trends, but also giving us a detailed snapshot of stock price movements over time.\n\n\nAnalysis\nLet’s assume we put $1,000 into each stock at the beginning of 2010. We’ll use our adjusted prices to track how much that $1,000 would have turned into by 2022. By looking at the charts for each stock, we can see the final tally for our investment as of 2022, giving us a clear picture of where our hypothetical $1,000 would have taken us over 12 years.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nIn this part, We take the list of stock symbols and create a line graph for each stock that shows how its closing price has changed day by day. The result is a colorful chart where each line represents a company’s stock, making it easy to see how stock prices have moved over time.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nIn this part, we’re starting all the stocks from the same line (‘normalization’), so we can compare them fairly. Imagine every stock begins at $10 in 2010, and we track how this value changes. This gives us a clear picture of each stock’s performance relative to the others, regardless of their actual price differences. We draw this out on a chart, so it’s easy to follow their growth over the years.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nIn this part, we’re focusing on Apple’s stock (AAPL) as an example, and we’re using two smoothed-out lines to help us decide when might be a good time to buy or sell. These lines represent the average closing price over the last 50 and 200 days. We plot these on a special kind of graph called a ‘candlestick chart’, which not only shows the average trends but also the daily price movements in more detail. This chart helps us spot those key moments where the short-term average crosses over the long-term average, which can signal whether it’s potentially a good time to get in or out of the market.\n\n\nDiscussion\nInsights into investment strategies and market dynamics.\nBy leveraging historical market data and DMA models, we gained a understanding of how different investment options perform over time. This allowed us to identify trends and patterns that could inform investment decisions, such as identifying stocks with consistent growth or bonds with stable returns. There are a few perceptions on the visualizations. In 2010, IBM stood out with the highest close price among the companies analyzed. From 2018 to 2022, there was a notable exponential growth in stock close prices. By 2021, both Netflix and ADE were nearly on par with their close prices. However, they both experienced declines afterward. Apart from Tesla and Netflix, the other companies remained relatively stable in their normalized stock market performance. Netflix maintained stability in its stock market performance.\nMarket conditions are subject to change, and unforeseen events or economic factors can impact investment performance. Therefore, it’s essential for investors to continuously monitor and adapt their strategies in response to evolving market dynamics. Analyzing daily price data using the 200-day moving average (DMA) and the 50-day DMA method revealed that the 50 DMA consistently showed stronger pricing performance compared to the 200 DMA."

We will employ visualizations such as line graphs to depict trends and use measures such as the moving average to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.\n\n\nQ2: Backwards verification: if we invested x amount of dollars in 2010, how much would it be worth in 2022, when would be a good/bad time to pull investment out of the market.\nBy simulating an investment strategy where a fixed amount, say $10,000, is invested in a diversified portfolio of these tech stocks in 2010, we will compute its valuation in 2022. We will use the adj_close prices to account for stock splits and dividends. The analysis will also involve calculating the rate of return, identifying peaks and troughs in investment value over time, and determining strategic entry and exit points in the market."

Each day has a total of 8 variables.\n\nFor Example: A Candlestick plot\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot\nimport warnings\nwarnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\", category=FutureWarning)\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\ndf = stocks.copy()\ndf['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])\n\ndf_google = df[df['stock_symbol'] == 'GOOGL']\n# Creating a candlestick chart\nfig = go.Figure(data=[go.Candlestick(x=df_google['date'],\n                open=df_google['open'],\n                high=df_google['high'],\n                low=df_google['low'],\n                close=df_google['close'],\n                name=\"Candlestick\")])\n\n# Customizing the layout\nfig.update_layout(title='Candlestick Chart Example with GOOGLE stock',\n                  xaxis_title='Date',\n                  yaxis_title='Price',\n                  xaxis_rangeslider_visible=False,\n                  height=400)\n\n# Showing the figure\nfig.show()\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nAnd visualizing all stocks at once using line plots.\n\nstocks = companies['stock_symbol'].values.tolist()\n# Creating a DataFrame to hold all the stock data\n# For simplicity, let's generate some random closing prices\nall_stock_data = df\n\n# Create a Plotly figure\nfig = go.Figure()\n\n# Add a line for each stock\nfor stock in stocks:\n    stock_data = df[df['stock_symbol'] == stock]\n    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=stock_data['date'], y=stock_data['close'], mode='lines', name=stock))\n\n# Customize the layout\nfig.update_layout(\n    title='Stock Close Prices Over Time',\n    xaxis_title='Date',\n    yaxis_title='Close Price',\n    height=400\n)\n\n# Show the figure\nfig.show()\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nWe plan to answer question one by investigating the rate of change of trading volume and average price over time to find trends that reveal good times to invest, i.e. when stock prices are about to grow exponentially, we would invest our money. Inversely, if we saw an exponential decrease in price over time, we would want to take our money out ASAP.\n\n\n\nQ2\nTo determine the value of an investment in 2022 based on an initial investment in 2010, we need to know the annual rate of return of the investment over that time period. Without this information, it’s impossible to calculate the exact value of the investment in 2022.\nHowever, we can make some generalizations:\n\n1.Using Historical Market Data\n2.Consulting Financial Professionals\n\n\nAnalysis\nWe will use DMA(daily moving averages) to create a generalized equation for how each stock grows over time, we can then see how money will grow in each stock by setting an initial investment and seeing its final value in 2022. To do so, we need to understand factors like inflation and interest rates, as well as annual rate of return."
