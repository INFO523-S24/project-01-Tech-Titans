Key variables within the dataset include stock_symbol, date, open, high, low, close, adj_close, and volume, all of which offer insights into daily stock performance\n\nbig_tech_companies.csv: This file serves as metadata, providing the names of companies alongside their associated stock symbols.\n\nMake sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.\n\n## Reason for Choosing This Dataset\n\nWe chose this dataset for its potential to provide valuable insights into the stock market behavior of big tech companies. The dataset encompasses a range of data types, including numerical values like stock prices and trading volumes and categorical data such as company names and dates. This composition enables a comprehensive examination of stock market trends, facilitates comparisons across various companies, and aids in assessing the influence of significant external events on stock valuations.\n\n## Questions\n\nThe two questions you want to answer.\n\n-   How do stock prices change over time, looking at the basic information like open, close, high, low etc.\n-   Backwards verification: if we invested x amount of dollars in 2010, how much would it be worth in 2022, when would be a good/bad time to pull investment out of the market\n\n## Analysis plan\n\nAnalyzing stock prices from Big Tech Stock Price dataset over time using open, close, high, and low values. Creating visualizations like candlestick charts, line plots and bar plots to gain insights into the stock's behavior. Bar plot depicts the volume of the stock which implies that taller the bar higher the stock trade. Each day has a total of 8 variables.\n\nTo determine the value of an investment in 2022 based on an initial investment in 2010, we need to know the annual rate of return of the investment over that time period. Without this information, it's impossible to calculate the exact value of the investment in 2022.\n\nHowever, we can make some generalizations:\n\n1.Using Historical Market Data\n\n2.Consulting Financial Professionals\n\n",
