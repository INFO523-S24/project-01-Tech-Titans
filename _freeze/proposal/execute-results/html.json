The dataset comprises the daily stock prices and volume of 14 different tech companies, including Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and more.\n\nThere are 2 CSV files in the dataset:\n\nbig_tech_stock_prices.csv:\nThis  includes stock market data for various big tech companies. Key variables such as stock_symbol, date, open, high, low, close, adj_close, and volume offer insights into daily stock performance.\n\nbig_tech_companies.csv:\nThis data focuses on the major technology companies represented in the stock prices dataset. It features variables like stock_symbol and company, providing the stock symbols and full names of the corresponding companies\n\nMake sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.\n\n## Reason for Choosing This Dataset\n\nWe chose this dataset for its potential to provide valuable insights into the stock market behavior of big tech companies. The dataset encompasses a range of data types, including numerical values like stock prices and trading volumes and categorical data such as company names and dates. This composition enables a comprehensive examination of stock market trends, facilitates comparisons across various companies, and aids in assessing the influence of significant external events on stock valuations.\n\n## Questions\n\nThe two questions you want to answer.\n\n- How do stock prices change over time, looking at the basic information like open, close, high, low etc.\n- Backwards verification: if we invested x amount of dollars in 1990, how much would it be worth today, when would be a good/bad time to pull investment out of the market\n\n## Analysis plan\n\n-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).\n\n",
