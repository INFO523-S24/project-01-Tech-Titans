## Meeting Notes

### 020424
- Decided our two questions
  * How do stock prices change over time, looking at the basic information like open, close, high, low etc.
  * Backwards verification: if we invested x amount of dollars in 1990, how much would it be worth today, when would be a good/bad time to pull investment out of the market
- Split the work up to ensure everyone commits to the proposal.qmd
- Try to ensure everyone is in group meetings moving forward to improve communications
