## Dataset

This dataset, "Big Tech Stock Prices," sourced from Yahoo Finance via Kaggle (by Evan Gower), provides information on stock prices and associated details for prominent 14 technology companies including Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), and more..

There are 2 CSV files in the dataset:

big_tech_stock_prices.csv: This file comprises 45,087 observations across 8 variables, encompassing stock market data for 14 major technology companies. Key variables within the dataset include stock_symbol, date, open, high, low, close, adj_close, and volume, all of which offer insights into daily stock performance

```{python}
stocks = pd.read_csv('data/big_tech_stock_prices.csv')
stocks.head()
```

big_tech_companies.csv: This file serves as metadata, providing the names of companies alongside their associated stock symbols.

```{python}
companies = pd.read_csv('data/big_tech_companies.csv')
companies.head()
```

## Reason for Choosing This Dataset

We chose this dataset for its potential to provide valuable insights into the stock market behavior of big tech companies. The dataset encompasses a range of data types, including numerical values like stock prices and trading volumes and categorical data such as company names and dates. This composition enables a comprehensive examination of stock market trends, facilitates comparisons across various companies, and aids in assessing the influence of significant external events on stock valuations.

## Questions

The two questions you want to answer.


### **Q1:  How do stock prices change over time, looking at the basic information like open, close, high, low etc.**

### **Q2:  Backwards verification: if we invested x amount of dollars in 2010, how much would it be worth in 2022, when would be a good/bad time to pull investment out of the market.**

## Analysis plan


### Q1
Analyzing stock prices from Big Tech Stock Price dataset over time using open, close, high, and low values. Creating visualizations like candlestick charts, line plots and bar plots to gain insights into the stock's behavior. Bar plot depicts the volume of the stock which implies that taller the bar higher the stock trade. Each day has a total of 8 variables.

#### **For Example: A Candlestick plot**

```{python}

import warnings
warnings.simplefilter("ignore", category=FutureWarning)
import plotly.graph_objects as go
df = stocks.copy()
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])

df_google = df[df['stock_symbol'] == 'GOOGL']
# Creating a candlestick chart
fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Candlestick(x=df_google['date'],
                open=df_google['open'],
                high=df_google['high'],
                low=df_google['low'],
                close=df_google['close'],
                name="Candlestick")])

# Customizing the layout
fig.update_layout(title='Candlestick Chart Example with GOOGLE stock',
                  xaxis_title='Date',
                  yaxis_title='Price',
                  xaxis_rangeslider_visible=False,
                  height=400)

# Showing the figure
fig.show()
```

#### **And visualizing all stocks at once using line plots.**


```{python}
stocks = companies['stock_symbol'].values.tolist()
# Creating a DataFrame to hold all the stock data
# For simplicity, let's generate some random closing prices
all_stock_data = df

# Create a Plotly figure
fig = go.Figure()

# Add a line for each stock
for stock in stocks:
    stock_data = df[df['stock_symbol'] == stock]
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=stock_data['date'], y=stock_data['close'], mode='lines', name=stock))

# Customize the layout
fig.update_layout(
    title='Stock Close Prices Over Time',
    xaxis_title='Date',
    yaxis_title='Close Price',
    height=400
)

# Show the figure
fig.show()
```


#### Analysis
We plan to answer question one by investigating the rate of change of trading volume and average price over time to find trends that reveal good times to invest, i.e. when stock prices are about to grow exponentially, we would invest our money. Inversely, if we saw an exponential decrease in price over time, we would want to take our money out ASAP.

### Q2
To determine the value of an investment in 2022 based on an initial investment in 2010, we need to know the annual rate of return of the investment over that time period. Without this information, it's impossible to calculate the exact value of the investment in 2022. 

However, we can make some generalizations:

- 1.Using Historical Market Data

- 2.Consulting Financial Professionals

#### Analysis
We will use DMA(daily moving averages) to create a generalized equation for how each stock grows over time, we can then see how money will grow in each stock by setting an initial investment and seeing its final value in 2022. To do so, we need to understand factors like inflation and interest rates, as well as annual rate of return.
