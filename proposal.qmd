## Questions

The two questions you want to answer.

Q1:  How do stock prices change over time, looking at the basic information like open, close, high, low etc.
Q2:  Backwards verification: if we invested x amount of dollars in 2010, how much would it be worth in 2022, when would be a good/bad time to pull investment out of the market

## Analysis plan


### Q1
Analyzing stock prices from Big Tech Stock Price dataset over time using open, close, high, and low values. Creating visualizations like candlestick charts, line plots and bar plots to gain insights into the stock's behavior. Bar plot depicts the volume of the stock which implies that taller the bar higher the stock trade. Each day has a total of 8 variables.

### Q2

However, we can make some generalizations:

1.Using Historical Market Data

2.Consulting Financial Professionals
