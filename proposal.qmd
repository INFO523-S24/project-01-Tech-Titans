This composition enables a comprehensive examination of stock market trends, facilitates comparisons across various companies, and aids in assessing the influence of significant external events on stock valuations.

## Questions

The two questions you want to answer.

- How do stock prices change over time, looking at the basic information like open, close, high, low etc.
- Backwards verification: if we invested x amount of dollars in 1990, how much would it be worth today, when would be a good/bad time to pull investment out of the market

## Analysis plan

-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).
